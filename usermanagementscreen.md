# User Management Screen - UI Specification

## 1. Overview
The User Management Screen is a comprehensive interface designed to facilitate the management of users within the system. It provides administrators with a centralized platform to perform various user-related operations, ensuring efficient user lifecycle management. This screen plays a crucial role in enabling administrators to view, add, modify, enable/disable, and delete user accounts, allowing for seamless control over access to the system.

Key Functionalities:
User Overview: The screen presents an interactive and filterable table displaying a list of all users in the system. The table includes essential details such as the unique user ID, username, email address, and whether the account is enabled or disabled. This provides administrators with an at-a-glance view of the users' statuses, making it easy to identify active users and manage them accordingly.

User Creation: Administrators can create new user accounts by clicking on the + New User button, which clears the form on the right side of the screen and allows for the input of new user data. Required fields such as Username, Email, and User Roles are enforced to maintain data integrity. Once all necessary information is provided, the system will validate and save the new user to the database.

User Modification: By selecting an existing user from the table, the corresponding user's details are loaded into the editable form. Administrators can update fields such as username, email, roles, and the enabled status. Changes can be saved by clicking the Save User button after the form passes validation. This feature helps administrators quickly update user information as needed.

User Activation/Deactivation: Administrators have the ability to enable or disable user accounts through the Enabled checkbox. A disabled user will not have access to the system, and this status is reflected in the user table. Additionally, the table provides a Hide Disabled Users checkbox to filter out inactive users from the list.

User Deletion: Administrators can delete user accounts from the system. This functionality helps maintain a clean and accurate user list by removing accounts that are no longer needed.

Filtering and Sorting: The user table provides powerful filtering and sorting options for each column, making it easy for administrators to find specific users or groups of users (e.g., searching by username or filtering to show only active accounts). Sorting can be performed in ascending or descending order based on the selected column.

Form Validation: The system ensures that all required fields, such as Username, Email, and User Roles, are filled out and correctly formatted. Unique constraints (such as for Username and Email) are enforced both client-side and server-side, preventing duplicate user records and maintaining data consistency.

## 2. Requirements
The following are the functional and non-functional requirements for the User Management Screen. These requirements ensure that the interface meets both the operational needs of the administrators and the technical expectations for the system.

## 2.1 Functional Requirements
The User Management Screen must allow administrators to perform the following actions effectively:

## 2.1.1 View the List of Users
Purpose: Administrators need to access a list of all users currently registered in the system.
Details:
The system should display a table that lists users with the following attributes: User ID, Username, Email, and Enabled status.
Users should be displayed in a paginated or scrollable format to handle large datasets efficiently.
Each column in the table should be sortable, allowing the administrator to sort users based on ID, Username, Email, or Enabled status.
Filters should be available for each column to refine the list of users based on specific criteria (e.g., filtering by enabled status or searching by username).

## 2.1.2 Add New Users
Purpose: Administrators must be able to add new users to the system.
Details:
A New User form should be available, with required fields including Username, Email, User Roles, and optional fields like Phone and Display Name.
The form must include proper validation to ensure that all required fields are filled and that the input follows the appropriate formats (e.g., email format, phone number format).
The Username and Email must be unique, and the system should verify this on both the client and server sides to avoid duplicates.
The User Roles field must allow the administrator to select one or more roles for the new user, and at least one role is mandatory for submission.
Once the user information is successfully submitted, the new user should be added to the database, and the user table should refresh to reflect the new addition.

## 2.1.3 Edit Existing Users
Purpose: Administrators must be able to modify the details of existing users.
Details:
When a user is selected from the user table, the Edit User form should be populated with the current details of the selected user.
Administrators should be able to edit any field (e.g., Username, Email, User Roles, Phone, Display Name).
Changes to Username and Email must be validated to ensure they remain unique and correctly formatted.
The system must notify the administrator of any validation errors before submitting the form (e.g., email already exists, invalid phone number format).
Upon successful submission, the modified user details should be saved, and the user table should refresh to reflect the updated information.

## 2.1.4 Enable or Disable Users
Purpose: Administrators should have the ability to enable or disable user accounts, controlling their access to the system.
Details:
The Enabled checkbox in the user form indicates the status of the user account (enabled or disabled).
Administrators should be able to toggle the status of the user by checking or unchecking the Enabled checkbox.
If a user is disabled, they should not be able to log in or access any system functionalities until they are re-enabled.
The system should provide visual feedback (e.g., a message or indicator) confirming the successful enablement or disablement of a user.

## 2.1.5 Filter Users Based on Enabled Status
Purpose: Administrators must be able to filter the user list to quickly find users who are either enabled or disabled.
Details:
A Hide Disabled Users checkbox should be available above the user table, allowing administrators to toggle the visibility of disabled users.
When the checkbox is checked, only users with the Enabled status set to true should be visible in the table.
When unchecked, both enabled and disabled users should be displayed.
This filtering should be applied in conjunction with any other table filters (e.g., username search or role-based filters).

## 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
The non-functional requirements define how the system should behave and ensure the user interface meets certain quality standards:

## 2.2.1 Responsiveness and Browser Compatibility
Purpose: The interface must adapt to different screen sizes and be compatible with modern web browsers.
Details:
The interface should be fully responsive, ensuring that it adjusts properly across various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Key UI elements, such as the user table and form, should remain usable and visually appealing when resized.
The UI must be compatible with all modern browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari.
Features like sorting, filtering, and form submission must function consistently across browsers.

## 2.2.2 Form Validation and Data Integrity
Purpose: Ensure that all input data is properly validated before it is processed or stored in the system.
Details:
All forms should include both client-side and server-side validation to prevent invalid data from being submitted.
Required fields such as Username, Email, and User Roles must be checked to ensure they are not empty.
Fields like Email and Phone should be validated for correct formatting (e.g., email must include @ and a domain, phone numbers must match a valid pattern).
Duplicate entries for Username and Email must be prevented by performing a uniqueness check both when the form is filled (client-side) and during submission (server-side).
If validation fails, meaningful error messages should be displayed next to the respective fields, guiding the user on how to correct their input.

## 2.2.3 Error Handling and Feedback
Purpose: Ensure that any errors encountered during form submission, API requests, or user interactions are handled gracefully, providing appropriate feedback to the administrator.
Details:
Client-Side Errors: If the administrator fails to fill out required fields or provides invalid input, the form should not be submitted. The system should display clear and concise error messages next to the relevant fields (e.g., "Username already exists" or "Invalid email format").
Server-Side Errors: If the API returns an error (e.g., duplicate email or network issues), the UI must handle these gracefully by displaying an error message to the administrator, such as `An unexpected error occurred, please try again.`
Loading States: The interface should provide visual feedback (e.g., loading spinners) when waiting for a response from the server during actions like saving user data or filtering the user table.
Success Feedback: After successfully creating or updating a user, the system should display a success message (e.g., `User successfully added` or `User details updated`).

## 2.2.4 Performance and Scalability
Purpose: Ensure that the user interface remains performant and scalable, even as the number of users increases.
Details:
The user table should efficiently handle large datasets, using pagination or infinite scrolling to avoid performance degradation.
Filtering and sorting operations must be optimized to work seamlessly even with thousands of records.
The system should minimize the number of API requests, using techniques like batching requests or caching data where applicable.

## 2.3 Security Considerations
Purpose: Ensure that user data and administrative actions are handled securely.
Details:
Authorization: Only authorized administrators should have access to the user management screen. Proper authentication mechanisms should be in place to restrict access.
Data Validation: All inputs must be sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
Audit Trails: Changes made to user accounts (e.g., enabling, disabling, or modifying users) should be logged to keep track of administrative actions for auditing purposes.

## 3. Initial Page Load
When the User Management Screen is loaded, the interface is designed to provide a clear and intuitive starting point for administrators to manage user accounts. The page layout is divided into two main sections: the User Table on the left and the New User Form on the right. Below are the details of each element that is displayed upon initial page load:

## 3.1 User Table
The User Table is the central component of the screen, displaying a list of users currently in the system. It consists of the following elements:

Columns:
ID:
Displays the unique numeric identifier for each user in the system.
This column is auto-populated by the system and is non-editable.
User Name:
Displays the username of each user.
This is the primary identifier used by administrators to manage users.
The table supports sorting by username (both ascending and descending).
Email:
Displays the email address associated with each user.
The email is a required, unique field for each user and is used for communication and login purposes.
The table allows sorting by email (both ascending and descending).
Enabled:
Displays the current status of the user (either true or false).
true means the user is enabled and can access the system, while false means the user is disabled and has no system access.
The enabled status can be toggled when editing a user, and this column is also sortable.
Functionalities:
Sorting: Each column header allows sorting the users in ascending or descending order. By default, the table is sorted by User ID in ascending order.

Filtering:

Each column includes a filter input. For instance, administrators can filter users by entering part of the username or email in the relevant filter box.
The Enabled column allows filtering users based on their enabled/disabled status.
Pagination: If the number of users exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 50 users), the table should implement pagination or infinite scrolling. The default setting can display 10, 25, or 50 users per page, with navigation controls at the bottom of the table for moving between pages.

User Selection: Clicking on a row in the user table highlights the row and loads the selected user's details into the form on the right. The user can then be edited or updated.

## 3.2 Hide Disabled User Checkbox
Location: Positioned above the user table.

Functionality:

When this checkbox is checked, the user table will filter out all users who have the Enabled status set to false. Only users with Enabled = true will be visible in the table.
When unchecked, both enabled and disabled users will be displayed in the user table.
Behavior:

By default, the checkbox is unchecked, displaying all users.
Toggling the checkbox will trigger a refresh of the table, applying or removing the filter based on the user's enabled status.
The filter operates independently of other filters applied to the table (e.g., filtering by username or email).
## 3.3 New User Form
The New User Form is displayed on the right side of the screen and serves as both a form for adding new users and a form for editing existing users. Upon initial page load, the form is empty, awaiting either the creation of a new user or the selection of an existing user for editing.

Form Fields:
Username:

A required field where the administrator can enter a unique username for the user.
The field is empty upon initial load but will be populated with the selected user's details if a row is clicked in the user table.
When creating or editing a user, the system validates the uniqueness of the username.
Display Name:

An optional field where the administrator can enter the display name of the user.
This field is primarily for identification purposes and is not used for login or system authentication.
It is empty on page load but populated when an existing user is selected for editing.
Phone:

An optional field for entering the user's phone number. The phone number format is validated for correctness (e.g., +1 555-555-5555).
It is initially blank and is used to contact users if necessary.
Email:

A required field for entering the user’s unique email address. The system checks to ensure that the email format is correct and that it is unique within the system.
Like other fields, it is empty on load but populated when an existing user is selected for editing.
User Roles:

A multi-select dropdown where administrators can assign one or more roles to a user (e.g., Guest, Admin, SuperAdmin).
This field is required, and at least one role must be selected before the user can be saved. If no roles are selected, the system displays a validation error.
Upon page load, the dropdown is empty, but when editing a user, their assigned roles are pre-selected.
Enabled:

A checkbox indicating whether the user account is active (Enabled). When checked, the user is enabled and can access the system; when unchecked, the user is disabled.
By default, the checkbox is unchecked (i.e., the user is disabled) when creating a new user. When editing an existing user, the checkbox reflects their current enabled/disabled status.
Buttons:
Save User:

This button is disabled by default on initial page load because the form is empty. It becomes enabled once the form is filled with valid data (e.g., when required fields such as Username, Email, and User Roles are populated).
When clicked, the system will validate the data and either create a new user (if it's a new entry) or update the details of the selected user (if editing an existing user).
Upon successful form submission, the user table will refresh to display the new or updated user.
New User:

Positioned above the form, this button allows the administrator to create a new user.
Clicking the button clears any existing data in the form, resetting it to blank. The administrator can then enter details for a new user.
## 3.4 Default State on Page Load
Upon loading the page:

The User Table displays the full list of users, sorted by User ID in ascending order.
The Hide Disabled User checkbox is unchecked, meaning all users (enabled and disabled) are visible by default.
The New User Form on the right is completely empty, ready to either create a new user or display details of a selected user when clicked from the table.
This layout provides administrators with a clear, simple view of users in the system and easy access to user management functionalities.

| **Display Name** | Text     | The display name of the user.                                                                                  | Optional, 3-100 characters.                                                                            |
| **Phone**        | Text     | The user’s phone number.                                                                                       | Optional, must match a valid phone number format (e.g., `+1 555-555-5555`).                            |
| **Email**        | Text     | A unique email address associated with the user.                                                               | Required, must follow standard email format, must be unique.                                           |
| **User Roles**   | Dropdown | A dropdown that allows selecting one or more roles (e.g., `Guest`, `Admin`, `SuperAdmin`).                     | Required, at least one role must be selected.                                                          |
| **Enabled**      | Checkbox | A checkbox indicating whether the user is enabled.                                                             | Optional, checked = enabled, unchecked = disabled.                                                     |

#### Field Behaviors
- **Username**:
  - The system checks for uniqueness when the user moves focus away from the field.
  - If the username is already taken, an error message is displayed.
  
- **Email**:
  - The system validates that the email is in a proper format and unique.
  - If the email is already used, an error message is shown.

- **User Roles**:
  - The dropdown allows selecting multiple roles.
  - At least one role must be selected for the form to be valid.

- **Enabled**:
  - Default state is unchecked (disabled).
  - If checked, the user will be enabled; if unchecked, the user will be disabled.

### 4.4 Form Behavior and Validation
- **Selecting a User**: When a user is selected from the table, their information populates the form for editing. The form becomes editable, and the `Save User` button is enabled if required fields are filled.
- **Creating a New User**: Clicking the `+ New User` button resets the form, allowing the administrator to create a new user. The `Save User` button is enabled once all required fields are filled.
- **Form Validation**:
  - Username and Email must be unique and properly formatted.
  - All required fields must be filled.
  - If validation fails, an error message is shown below the relevant field.

## 5. Error Handling
Proper error handling should be implemented to ensure user input errors and system issues are managed.

### 5.1 Client-Side Validation
- Required fields like `Username`, `Email`, and `User Roles` must be filled before the form can be submitted.
- If validation errors occur (e.g., invalid email format, missing fields), the corresponding field is highlighted, and an error message is displayed below it.
- The `Save User` button remains disabled until the form passes validation.

### 5.2 Server-Side Validation
- When submitting the form, if the server detects a duplicate `Username` or `Email`, an error message is returned, and the user is notified on the form.
- If a network error occurs or the server cannot process the request, a general error message is displayed (e.g., "An unexpected error occurred, please try again.").

## 6. API Endpoints
### 6.1 Required API Calls
- **GET /api/users**: Retrieves the list of users to display in the user table.
- **POST /api/users**: Adds a new user to the system.
- **PUT /api/users/{id}**: Updates an existing user's information.
- **DELETE /api/users/{id}**: Removes a user from the system.

### 6.2 Error Handling in API Calls
- If an API call fails, the system should display a relevant message (e.g., `Unable to fetch users` for GET requests or `Failed to save user` for POST/PUT requests).
- When a conflict occurs (e.g., duplicate email or username), the server should return a 409 Conflict response, which is handled by showing an appropriate error message to the user.
